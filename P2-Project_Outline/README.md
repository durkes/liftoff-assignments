## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The app will work like a mini-social network, similar to Facebook or Twitter. Small groups can use the app as a self-hosted social network for group engagement and private messaging. Each user can have a public timeline to post updates such as blog posts, status updates, or any content he/she would like to share within the group. Each user can also view other user timelines individual or as part of the larger group timeline. Each user can also message other users directly and privately.

The primary benefit of the application is that organizations can keep data contained and control the data, as opposed to using Facebook and Twitter. Although there will be fewer features, the application can be customized by other developers to meet a specific need.

The idea came from a need to use a social-network like application at work, but Facebook and Twitter being unapproved applications due to corporate security policies.

### Features
- **User sessions:** Each user will have to register and log in for each session
- **Timeline:** Each user can post content to a public timeline and view other user timelines
- **Groups:** Each organization can set up a group ID - each group will act as a mini-network. Users can only see public posts for other users in the same group.
- **Private messaging:** Users can direct-message other users in private (possibly with instant notifications so it can work like live chat)

### Technologies
- Node.js
- Harp.js (static web server with built-in preprocessing)
- node-router for AJAX/JSON
- sqlite for Node.js for database
- React.js or Vue.js
- CSS framework TBD

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn React/Vue and sqlite. I have no experience with React or Vue. I liked using Harp.js in the past but will need to gain proficiency. While SQL is simple with reference, I will need to spend some time designing the database to meet the requirements of the app.
